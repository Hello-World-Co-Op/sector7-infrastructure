    # Hello World Co-Op DAO

    Hello World Co-Op is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on the
    Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). We're building cooperative infrastructure for
    the digital age.

    ## What is a Co-Op DAO?
    A cooperative DAO combines the democratic principles of traditional cooperatives
    with the transparency and automation of blockchain technology.

    ## Key Features
    - **Member-Owned**: Every member has a voice through governance proposals
    - **Transparent**: All decisions are recorded on-chain
    - **Self-Custody**: You control your own identity and assets
    - **Community-Driven**: Built by and for the community
